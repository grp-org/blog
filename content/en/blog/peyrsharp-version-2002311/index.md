Version 2.0.0.2311 of PeyrSharp is now available. This version doesn't bring any new features; however, we added .NET 8 to the list of targeted frameworks. Please also note that we decided to remove support for .NET 5 since it is no longer supported. If you still rely on .NET 5, we advise you to upgrade to .NET 6 or 8 for Long Term Support (LTS).
