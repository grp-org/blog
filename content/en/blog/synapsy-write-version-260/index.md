A new version of Synapsy Write is now available and it is the version 2.6.0. We added Conversation Management, new formats, and made several improvements to the app

## History paragraph format

The new History paragraph format in Synapsy Write is designed to generate high-quality historical content with precision and clarity. Leveraging a specialized method tailored for history subjects, the AI begins each paragraph with a general statement of the main idea. It then meticulously incorporates precise dates, specific historical events, significant figures and their roles, and key concepts. For instance, a paragraph might detail the events of July 14, 1789, describing the storming of the Bastille, highlighting the role of revolutionary leaders like Camille Desmoulins, and explaining its significance in sparking the French Revolution. This structured approach ensures that each paragraph is rich in historical references and concise, providing students with clear, informative, and well-organized content.

## New Conversations system

The new Conversations Management system in Synapsy Write offers a seamless and efficient way to handle interactions with the Synapsy Assistant. Now, conversations are saved locally in the browser storage, allowing users to easily access and manage their dialogue history. This feature enables users to create new conversations, edit existing ones, or remove those no longer needed, providing a flexible and user-friendly experience.

## Other improvements

The latest updates to Synapsy Write bring a host of new features and improvements designed to enhance user experience and functionality. Tooltips have been added to the Create page to provide helpful guidance and improve navigation. The Chat page now features new icons and animations, making interactions more engaging, along with a copy button for easier sharing of generated content. Users can now enjoy a Sort button in the History section, allowing for more efficient organization of past activities. Additionally, the Pricing page includes a conversation management row, offering clearer information about managing conversations. Several fixes have been implemented, including resolving a dependency issue and fixing an issue with the dark theme to ensure consistent appearance across the app. Updates include an enhanced Features table, the removal of the Edit button in Generations for unsupported formats, and updated dependencies to ensure the app runs smoothly with the latest technology.
