## Introduction

We're excited to announce the launch of the new and improved Status Page for Peyronnet Group, which now serves as the central hub for monitoring the status of all our services, including Léo Corporation, Synapsy, and Peyronnet Account. This update marks a significant step forward in our commitment to transparency, reliability, and user experience.

## Deprecation of the Old Léo Corporation Status Page

As part of this upgrade, we are deprecating the old status page of Léo Corporation. While that page has served us well in the past, we recognized the need for a more comprehensive and integrated solution that could support the evolving needs of our users. The new Status Page not only replaces the old one but also brings together the status of all services under the Peyronnet Group umbrella, providing a seamless experience for our users.

## A Modern, Robust Platform Built from the Ground Up

The new Status Page isn't just a facelift; it's a completely new platform, built from the ground up using some of the most advanced web technologies available today. We chose to build this platform with **Next.js**, **React**, and **shadcn/ui** to ensure it is fast, responsive, and easy to use. These technologies allow us to deliver a modern and robust user experience, with real-time updates and a clean, intuitive interface.

### Why Next.js and React?

Next.js and React are both leading technologies in web development, known for their performance, scalability, and developer-friendly features. By leveraging these technologies, we can ensure that the Status Page loads quickly, runs smoothly, and scales effectively to handle increasing traffic as our user base grows.

## Unified Access to All Services

One of the key benefits of the new Status Page is that it provides unified access to the status of all Peyronnet Group services:

- **Léo Corporation**: For users familiar with the old status page, you’ll now find all updates and historical data seamlessly integrated into the new platform.
- **Synapsy**: Get real-time updates on the status of Synapsy services, ensuring you’re always informed of any issues or maintenance schedules.
- **Peyronnet Account**: Track the status of Peyronnet Account services in the same centralized location, making it easier than ever to stay up-to-date.

## Access to Historical Data

We understand that historical incident data is crucial for many of our users. That's why we've made sure to carry over all archived incidents from the old Léo Corporation status page to the new platform. You can access these records just as you did before, ensuring continuity and preserving valuable information.

## Visit the New Status Page

The new Status Page is live and can be accessed at [https://status.peyronnet.group](https://status.peyronnet.group). We encourage all users to bookmark this page and use it as their primary source for updates on the status of Peyronnet Group services.

## Conclusion

This new Status Page represents our ongoing dedication to improving the user experience across all Peyronnet Group services. By centralizing status information for Léo Corporation, Synapsy, and Peyronnet Account in one place, and by building this platform with modern technologies like Next.js, React, and shadcn/ui, we are ensuring that you have access to the most reliable and up-to-date information available.

We are confident that this new platform will serve our users better, providing a more integrated, responsive, and user-friendly experience. Thank you for your continued trust in Peyronnet Group.
