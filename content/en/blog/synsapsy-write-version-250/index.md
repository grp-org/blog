A new version of Synapsy Write is now available and it is the version 2.5.0. This version adds several features, notably the new Synapsy Assistant Chat.

## Synapsy Chat Assistant

The new Chat feature of Synapsy Write revolutionizes document creation and information extraction by leveraging the advanced capabilities of GPT-3.5. This feature provides users with an interactive and intuitive UI to engage directly with an AI tailored for enhancing and drafting documents. Whether you need to refine existing text, generate new content, or extract key information from complex documents, the Chat feature simplifies these tasks with precision and efficiency. By offering real-time assistance and sophisticated language understanding, Synapsy Write ensures that your documentation processes are more streamlined, accurate, and productive than ever before.

## GPT-4o support

The integration of GPT-4o, the latest release from OpenAI, marks a significant leap forward in the capabilities of AI-driven language models. GPT-4o brings enhanced understanding, more nuanced language generation, and superior context management, making it an invaluable tool for a wide range of applications. This model excels in producing coherent, contextually appropriate responses, and its improved ability to comprehend and generate human-like text sets a new standard for AI performance.

## New Progress UI

The new progress UI for complex generations in Synapsy Write provides users with an intuitive and transparent way to track the ongoing creation process. This innovative interface clearly displays the current step in progress, allowing users to see exactly what Synapsy Write is generating at any given moment.
