## New Model Selector

One of the most significant additions in Synapsy Write v3.3.0 is the new model selector. This feature allows you to choose from a variety of AI models tailored to different types of content generation. Whether you need a model that excels in creative writing, technical documentation, or general text generation, the model selector ensures you have the right tool for the job. This flexibility empowers users to produce high-quality content that meets their specific needs.

## Enhanced Template Editor

The Template Editor in Synapsy Write v3.3.0 has been significantly enhanced with the introduction of a new type UI system. This system allows you to select between different types of generation modes, providing greater flexibility and control over your content creation process. Here's what you can expect:

-   **Dynamic**: This generation type is streamed and included in the final output. It's perfect for realtime feedback for the user.

-   **Static**: This generation type is not streamed but is included in the final output. It's perfect for content that doesn't require real-time updates but needs to be part of the final document, offering stability and consistency.

-   **Utility**: This generation type is static and not included in the final output. It's useful for creating helper templates or drafts that assist in the content creation process without being part of the end document, allowing for better organization and efficiency.

With the new type UI system, you can easily switch between these generation modes to tailor your templates to your specific needs, making the content creation process more versatile and efficient.

## Improved Editor with Math and LaTeX Support

This feature is now used by default in the view generation page, making it easier than ever to include mathematical expressions and scientific notation in your documents. Whether you're writing a research paper, creating educational content, or drafting technical documentation, the enhanced editor ensures your mathematical expressions are accurately represented.

## Additional Features and Improvements

-   **Reset Settings**: You can now reset settings to their default values, providing a quick way to start fresh if needed.
-   **Duplicate Templates**: Easily duplicate system and user templates to create variations or backups of your existing templates.
-   **Loading UI**: A new loading UI has been added when switching pages, providing a smoother and more intuitive user experience.
-   **Novel Editor as Default**: The Novel editor is now the default for the View page, offering a streamlined and efficient editing experience.

## Bug Fixes and Updates
