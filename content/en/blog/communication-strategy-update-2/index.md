We have some exciting news to share with you! As you may know, Léo Corporation has recently been integrated with Peyronnet Group, a leading company in the fields of innovation, technology and more. This means that we can now offer you a wider range of products and services that will help you achieve your goals and dreams.

To reflect this change, we have decided to rebrand our TikTok account from @leocorporation\_ to **@peyronnetgroup**. This way, you can stay updated on all the latest news, trends and tips from our diverse portfolio of brands and projects. You can also interact with us and share your feedback, questions and ideas. This change will allow us to post new content both on our [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@peyronnetgroup) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@PeyronnetGroup) accounts.

We are very grateful for your support and loyalty over the years. We hope you will continue to follow us on our new TikTok account [@peyronnetgroup](https://www.tiktok.com/@peyronnetgroup) and join us on this exciting journey!
