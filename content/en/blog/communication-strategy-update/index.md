## Update on the communication strategy for Léo Corporation and Devyus on YouTube

Hello everyone,

We have some exciting news to share with you regarding our communication strategy for Léo Corporation and Devyus on YouTube. As you may have noticed, the Léo Corporation YouTube channel has been closed and will be moved to the Peyronnet Group's YouTube channel. This is part of our plan to consolidate our online presence and create a unified brand identity for our group.

The Peyronnet Group's YouTube channel will be the new home for all the content related to Léo Corporation and Devyus, as well as other projects and initiatives from our group. You will be able to find informative videos, tutorials, demos, and more on this channel. We will also start making content for Devyus both as regular videos but also as YouTube Shorts, which are short-form videos that can be watched on any device.

We hope that you will enjoy this new format and that you will follow us on our Peyronnet Group's YouTube channel. You can subscribe to the channel by clicking [here](https://youtube.com/@PeyronnetGroup). We appreciate your support and feedback, and we look forward to creating more engaging and valuable content for you.

Thank you for being part of our community.

The Peyronnet Group team
