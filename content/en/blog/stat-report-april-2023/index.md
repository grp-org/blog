## Introduction

In the world of software development, it's not easy to stand out from the crowd. However, Peyronnet Group's subsidiaries, Léo Corporation and Devyus, have managed to do just that. In April 2023, both companies saw impressive growth in their respective areas of expertise.

## Léo Corporation

First, let's take a closer look at Léo Corporation. This innovative company is known for developing cutting-edge software applications that help users in various areas of their lives. From productivity tools to entertainment apps, Léo Corporation has a diverse range of products that cater to different needs.

The Léo Corporation's Apps have shown a positive trend in the number of downloads in April 2023. In this blog post, we will analyze the evolution of the number of downloads of each app and the overall increase percentage for the month.

Gavilya is the most downloaded app from the Léo Corporation in April with 1738 downloads, followed by Passliss Desktop and InternetTest Pro 7 with 1367 and 1252 downloads, respectively. The app that showed the highest growth in downloads in April was ColorPicker Max 5, with 103 downloads compared to 54 in March, representing an increase percentage of 90.7%.

Overall, the number of downloads of the Léo Corporation's Apps increased by 316 downloads in April compared to the previous month, reaching a total of 7656 downloads. This represents an increase percentage of 4.3%, which is slightly lower than the previous month's growth rate of 5.5%.

Looking at the evolution of the number of downloads of each app, Gavilya and Gerayis had a positive growth rate throughout the analyzed period, while the growth rates of InternetTest Pro 7 and Datalya declined in April compared to the previous month.

Finally, ColorPicker Max 5 had a significant increase in the number of downloads in April, making it the app with the highest growth rate in the analyzed period. This may indicate that the app is gaining popularity among users, and Léo Corporation may consider investing more resources to further develop it.

To summarize, the number of downloads of the Léo Corporation's Apps increased in April, but at a slightly lower rate than in previous months. The evolution of the number of downloads for each app indicates that some apps are growing steadily, while others are stagnating or declining. The data also highlights the importance of keeping track of the number of downloads to identify trends and make informed decisions regarding the development and promotion of apps.

## Devyus

Now let's shift our attention to Devyus. This subsidiary of Peyronnet Group specializes in providing NuGet packages to developers. These packages contain pre-built code that developers can use in their own software projects, saving them time and effort. In April 2023, Devyus' NuGet packages also saw a significant increase in adoption.

PeyrSharp is a NuGet package developed by Devyus that makes developers' lives easier while working in .NET applications. In March 2023, PeyrSharp had 15,860 downloads, which increased to 21,121 downloads in April 2023. This represents an increase percentage of 33.3%, which is a significant growth rate.

Synethia, another NuGet package developed by Devyus, provides an easy-to-use algorithm to help developers understand the habits of each user. In March 2023, Synethia had 417 downloads, and in April 2023, it had 640 downloads, representing an increase percentage of 53.4%.

These data show that both PeyrSharp and Synethia are gaining popularity among developers and are being increasingly adopted in .NET projects. The growth rate of PeyrSharp is particularly impressive, as it had a considerable increase in the number of downloads in just one month, indicating a significant increase in demand for this NuGet package.

It is essential to keep track of the number of downloads of NuGet packages to identify trends and understand which packages are gaining popularity among developers. This can help developers focus their efforts on the development and improvement of the most in-demand packages, which can lead to an increase in adoption and, ultimately, revenue.

In conclusion, the number of downloads of Devyus' NuGet Packages for PeyrSharp and Synethia increased significantly in April compared to March 2023, indicating a growing popularity among developers. Keeping track of the number of downloads is a useful metric to help developers identify trends and prioritize the development of the most in-demand packages.
