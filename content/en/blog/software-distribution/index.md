In this article, we will explore the trusted sources from which you can safely download Peyronnet Group (including Léo Corporation and Devyus) apps and address some common misconceptions surrounding the safety of their software.

## Trusted Sources for Downloading Peyronnet Group Apps

1. GitHub - [@Leo-Corporation](https://github.com/Leo-Corporation/), [@DevyusCode](https://github.com/DevyusCode/), and [@peyronnet-group](https://github.com/peyronnet-group/):
   Peyronnet Group distributes its applications through their official GitHub repositories. By downloading from these accounts, users can be assured of obtaining authentic and unaltered software.

2. Léo Corporation Web Store and [leocorporation.dev](https://leocorporation.dev) pages/subdomain:
   For a seamless experience, Peyronnet Group offers its apps on the Léo Corporation Web Store and specific pages or subdomains under leocorporation.dev. These platforms are reliable sources for their latest software.

3. Pages of the [peyronnet.group](https://peyronnet.group) domain:
   Users can also download Peyronnet Group apps from pages directly affiliated with the peyronnet.group domain. These pages ensure the integrity of the applications.

4. NuGet.org or GitHub Packages for Devyus packages:
   Devyus packages, specifically, can be safely downloaded from NuGet.org or GitHub Packages, providing a secure distribution channel for developers.

5. Links from Official Social Media Accounts:
   Peyronnet Group maintains a strong presence on various social media platforms. Links to their software shared on their official accounts, such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Leo-Corporation), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LeoCorpNews), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@leocorporation_), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/leocorporation_/), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LeoCorporationSoftwares/), can be trusted for safe downloads.

## Misconceptions and Clarifications

1. Third-Party Websites and Safety Concerns:
   It's crucial to emphasize that Peyronnet Group does not publish its software on third-party websites. The only trusted sources are those mentioned above. Downloading their apps from unauthorized sites may expose users to potential malware and security threats. Peyronnet Group cannot be held responsible for any issues arising from such downloads.

2. Antivirus Warnings for Unsigned Apps:
   Some users may receive warnings from their antivirus software about Peyronnet Group apps being unsigned. This is a false positive and does not indicate the presence of malware. The warnings occur because the apps lack a valid certificate; however, they are safe to use and have undergone rigorous testing.

3. App Identified as Trojan:
   In the event of an antivirus software flagging Peyronnet Group's app as a trojan, it is important to verify that the download originated from a trusted source. If downloaded from the official GitHub or web store, it is a false positive caused by the app's legitimate update system, which requires certain permissions for proper functioning. Rest assured, the app does not utilize these permissions for malicious purposes and is entirely secure for use.

## Conclusion

Peyronnet Group remains committed to providing its users with safe and reliable applications. To ensure the security of downloads, users must only obtain apps from the approved channels, including GitHub, Léo Corporation Web Store, and affiliated domains.
