A new version of Synapsy Write is now available and it is the version 3.1.0. This version includes a new login system and several fixes and improvements.

## New login system

The latest update to Synapsy Write, version 3.1.0, introduces a revamped login system designed to enhance user experience and security. This update replaces the old account management system with a new, streamlined Sign In page and account forms, offering a more intuitive and efficient process for accessing the platform. The integration of Supabase SSR ensures secure authentication, while localized support for the Sign In page caters to a global user base. Additionally, users will benefit from clear toaster notifications, guiding them through the login process with ease. This overhaul not only improves accessibility but also aligns with the platform's commitment to providing a seamless and secure user experience.
